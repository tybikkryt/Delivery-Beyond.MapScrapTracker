# Delivery-Beyond.MapScrapTracker
Simple client-side mod to display the amount of props and scrap left on the map. Updates in real time.

You can disable the display of elements you don't need and change position in config file:

```Delivery-Beyond\BepInEx\config\com.tybikkryt.map-scrap-tracker.cfg```

Default config is:

```
ShowProps = true
ShowScrap = true
PositionX = -430
PositionY = 25
```

# Changelog:

1.0.3: Fixed anchoring.

1.0.2: Added the ability to change the position. Improved visual style.

1.0.1: Added display for props and configuration options.

1.0.0: Added display for scrap.
